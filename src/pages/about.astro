          Anyway, this is probably a good place to stop. There’s more to my
          life than what I feel comfortable sharing here, but that’s about
          the gist of my background and interests. If you made it this far,
          cool! You’re still awake! Maybe we can chat sometime and get to
          know each other.

          At the end of the day, I’m just a Real Human Bean who enjoys doing
          real human things. If that sounds like your cup of tea, get in
          touch—I’d love to hear from you!
