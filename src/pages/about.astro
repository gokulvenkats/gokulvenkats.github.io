          When I'm not glued to my keyboard, you can catch me chasing the perfect shot with my camera, trying to convince pixels to pose. 
          Anyway, that's the scoop on me, but let's face it, there's more to life than code. 
          At the end of the day, I'm just a human who enjoys doing real human things. 
          If you're up for some tech talk or just want to share a good laugh, hit me upâ€”I promise I won't byte!"
